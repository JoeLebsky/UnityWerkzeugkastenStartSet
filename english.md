__Tell us, Joe, why didn't you provide an English version?__
That still is, after all, the international language most people speak...

Well, honestly, it's modesty. 
Yes, I know I say this as a German _(sorry, while I'm typing I am distracting myself: are you still modest if you mention that you are modest?)_, but the British mother _(of other kids, but she kind of half-raised me anyway)_ somehow installed an imaginary British modesty trainer in my head. _(That's my guess.)_

This trainer insisted that there are __plenty of fantastic Unity tutorials (in English) out there__ _(which is true, I hope I mentioned Unity.com learn section and the great Brackeys often enough in my videos :-)_, so if you _(in this case: I - it's difficult for some of us to have an imaginary dialogue, and it's even harder to explain it to another imaginary dialogue partner)_ ... where was I? ah ... so I was told that if I got the impression that some _(all)_ German kids/youngsters in my sample were unable to do 3D on a computer and if I got the impression that I could help with a German Unity tutorial _(of which there are also quite a few out there)_, well, then that would not be very modest of me but that I could of course go ahead and help them _(now that I read/type it I must admit that maybe I missed some mild irony there)_... 

... but he insisted/forbid me the thinking of "wow, I think that this little repetitive concept of environment, ready objects from Paint 3D, ready made code blocks _(even if you learn more by coding yourself - but that comes later hopefully)_ is really a yet unprovided quick starter and keeps the motivation high ... I should do it in English!" 

So that's the reason there is no international version in English. Excuse my long answer. Hello? Hello? Oh.
